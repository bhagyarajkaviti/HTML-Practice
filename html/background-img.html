    <h3>What is SDLC?</h3>    
    <p>
       SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process. <br><br>
       
        Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis <br> <br>
        
        Stage 2: Defining Requirements <br> <br>
        
        Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture <br> <br>
        
        Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product <br> <br>
        
        Stage 5: Testing the Product <br> <br>
        
        Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance <br> <br>

       <b>SDLC Models:</b> <br>There are various software development life cycle models defined and designed which are followed during the software development process. These models are also referred as Software Development Process Models". Each process model follows a Series of steps unique to its type to ensure success in the process of software development.

       Following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry âˆ’ <br>
      <ul>
        <li> Waterfall Model</li>
        <li>Iterative Model</li>
        <li>Spiral Model</li>
        <li> V-Model</li>
        <li> Big Bang Model</li>
       </ul>        
        </p>
    <p>Other related methodologies are Agile Model, RAD Model, Rapid Application Development and Prototyping Models.</p>
